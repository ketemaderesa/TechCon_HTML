# TechCon 2024 Conference Website

This project is a static website for **TechCon 2024**, an international technology conference that brings together developers, researchers, industry leaders, and innovators. The site is built using **HTML5** and demonstrates fundamental web development principles, such as semantic structure, accessibility, and responsive layout.

## 🔍 Description

The TechCon 2024 website is composed of five interconnected HTML pages:

- **Homepage (`index.html`)**: Introduces the conference with a welcome message and a promotional video.
- **About Page (`about.html`)**: Details the history, mission, and past speakers of TechCon with media-rich content.
- **Schedule Page (`schedule.html`)**: Presents a detailed, accessible timetable of all conference events using an HTML table.
- **Register Page (`register.html`)**: Features a user-friendly form for attendees to register for the conference.
- **Contact Page (`contact.html`)**: Displays contact information, social media links, an embedded Google Map, and a contact form.

Each page follows consistent structural and accessibility practices, including semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`), proper use of labels and alt attributes, and navigation.
